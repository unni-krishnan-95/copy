> How do I start in Cyber Security?
 
An all too familiar question that has been popping up on the [/r/AskNetSec](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetec/) and [/r/NetSecStudents](https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/) Subreddits, as well as in my e-mail.
 
With the increase in Cyber Crime, Corporate Breaches, Data Leaks, Malware and anything else related to "cyber" security the job field has expanded and with that expansion comes opportunity. The job market for Information Security Professionals is flourishing, offering many opportunities... but those positions are going un-filled.
 
Many will correlate the unfilled positions to the small amount of Security Professionals available, which although is true - but not entirely. Many of these unfilled positions are due to one aspect... experience.
 
Yes, experience - the hypocritical point of Information Security itself. To get a job in Security you need Security experience. Okay? How about for a Junior Position? You guessed it, you need experience! Internship? Experience!
 
At this point you might be wondering... _Well how can I get the experience I need, if I need experience to get experience?!_
 
Well my fellow reader, this is why I am here to help!
 
### About Me:
 
Before I get into the nitty-gritty details of how to break into Security let me provide you some background information of how I got my foot in the door, and how I attained a Security Position within a year of only working as an IT Client Service Intern.
 
I started my IT Career as an IT Client Service Intern in 2015 while still going to College - this was around my Sophomore Year. I knew that I wanted to start in Security, but never really knew how. The most logical step was to actually get computer experience, so working at a Help Desk position was beneficial.
 
I worked as Client Service Intern for around 1.5 Years before moving onto a Security Intern Position. A year later I graduated in 2017 with my Bachelor of Arts in Information Technology, and a Minor in Mathematics to which I was then hired as a full time Information Security Analyst with only 1 year of Security Experience under my belt.
 
During my time as a Security Intern I attained my [Security+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/security) Certificate and started working toward the [CEH](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/) and [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/). Unfortunately, I decided to skip out on taking the CEH as it seemed to be a waste of my time, and I opted to study just for the OSCP. Meantime at work I was studying for the [McAfee NSP Certificate](https://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/data-sheets/ds-network-security-platform-administration.pdf) which allowed me to attain more working knowledge on the McAfee NSM, IDS and IPS Solutions, Tuning, and Configurations.
 
 
Many people might consider me to be lucky - since it's impossible for someone with my experience and knowledge to get into a Security Position right out of college - and that is true! But, many people don't consider what goes on behind the scenes.
 
> What do you mean "behind the scenes"?
 
Simple... the sleepless nights, the long stressful hours spent studying, refining my skill, reading blogs, books, knowledge articles, etc.
 
I spent about a whole year pouring my heart and soul into security. I spent so much time reading and studying the material (while still in college) that I only got about 3-4 hours of sleep a night. My health deteriorated, my motivation slimed and at times I asked myself "_What's the point?_" but the point was simple... to break into security. To attain a goal in life, one must really put work and effort into that goal. In laymen terms "_Rome wasn't build overnight_".
 
### How to Start:
 
> Well, how can I start? What should I read? What should I learn?
 
Let's get one thing straight before we break down into how to get started.
 
Breaking into security is a "process" you will not learn everything overnight, it will take you weeks, months, even years to be "good enough"... but don't let that discourage you!
 
> Wait... how much do I have to learn?
 
A lot... if you don't want to devote your time to learning all the material and then keep learning for many years to come then I suggest you turn back now and go find yourself a different career. I'm being 100% serious here. You have to constantly keep learning in Security, with many new threats, tools, and advancements occurring you need to stay on top of everything. If you're the kind of person who hates self-learning and won't devote their time to learning then you will not get far.
 
> Alright, I'm ready, what's the "magic pill"?
 
There isn't a magic "red" pill that will teach you everything. As I explained earlier, breaking into Security is a "process" that you will need to devote a lot of time to. If you can't fall in love with the process of learning, and you don't have a burning passion or desire for security then you won't get far. You will burn yourself out and will sooner or later give up.
 
> Okay. I'm ready to devote myself. How do I start?
 
Well let's start by listing the basics and then break them down further. Here's a high level step-by-step overview.
 
1. Learn the Basics
2. Learn a Scripting/Programing Language
3. Learn how to use *Nix
4. Find your Niche
5. Practice, Practice, Practice... and Practice some more!
6. Become Active in the Community
7. Get Certified
8. Find a Job
 
### The Breakdown:
 
__1: Learn the Basics__
 
Ahh the basics, the 101, the appetizer, the foundation. Call it what you want, but these basics will be the building blocks to a successful Security Career.
 
You might have heard a lot of people tell you that you should find your "niche" in the field, but I believe that it's way too early for something like that. At this point everyone wants to be a "Penetration Tester" a "Hacker" but once they start learning about it they either hate it, don't like the continuous learning, or it's just not appealing to them.
 
The best thing to do is learn the basics, which will provide you the need to know for any Security related field. You need to remember that Security is the Surgeon of the Medical World. You need to have a wide amount of knowledge to succeed.
 
I highly suggest that you start off with going through [Professor Messer’s CompTIA SY0-401 Security+ Training Course](http://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-401/sy0-401-course-index/). Watch all the videos, take notes, and understand the concepts like the back of your hand. You should be able to recite all the concepts by heart once you're done with the course. This course will give you the backbone skills needed from Networking, TCP/IP Stack, OSI Model, Security Concepts, Threats, Tools, and more!
 
Everything related in the Security+ Certificate will relate back to real security functions and jobs. This will also open your eyes to the multiple paths in security and the many risks faced today.
 
__2. Learn a Scripting/Programing Language__
 
Although you might not program anything depending on your job, it's very good to know at least 1-2 languages.
 
Here are a few Languages I suggest you learn (not in any particular order):
 
* Python or Ruby or Both
* PowerShell
* Java
* PHP
* JavaScript
* C/C++
* SQL
 
I am a HUGE advocate for learning [Python](https://www.python.org/) specifically Version 2.7.13 because of the massive amount of libraries created - you could literally do anything with it. I also suggest you learn [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell) if you do anything with Windows because it is a freaking amazing tool at automating tasks and querying data in the Windows Environment.
 
There are pros and cons of learning these languages depending on job duties - but I will break them down more specifically when going over __Find your Niche__.
 
For now, just do some research on the languages and keep them in the back of your mind.
 
__3. Learn how to use *Nix__
 
[*Nix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) which is short for UNIX-Like and could be anything such as Linux, UNIX, etc.
 
In all honesty, learn how to use at least one of these OS's whether that is [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) or [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) or any other *Nix OS out there.
 
Learn the basics from the Command Line, File Shares, SSH, etc. The Security world revolves around Linux, so learn it, love it, live it. It might be a hard transition at first if you are used to Mac or Windows, but trust me, once you get the hang of it, there is no going back!
 
__4. Find your Niche__
 
Once you learn the basics, a programming language or two and understand the basics of a *nix OS, then you can start looking for your niche.
 
In a high level overview there are three paths you can take in the Security World.
 
1. Blue Team
2. Red Team
3. Purple Team
 
__Blue Team (Defense)__: refer to the internal security team that defends against both real attackers and Red Teams. Blue Teams should be distinguished from standard security teams in most organizations, as most security operations teams do not have a mentality of constant vigilance against attack, which is the mission and perspective of a true Blue Team.
 
__Red Team (Offense)__: are external entities brought in to test the effectiveness of a security program. This is accomplished by emulating the behaviors and techniques of likely attackers in the most realistic way possible. The practice is similar, but not identical to, Penetration Testing, and involves the pursuit of one or more objectives.
 
__Purple Team (Research/Hybrid)__: are ideally superfluous groups that exist to ensure and maximize the effectiveness of the Red and Blue teams. They do this by integrating the defensive tactics and controls from the Blue Team with the threats and vulnerabilities found by the Red Team into a single narrative that ensures the efforts of each are utilized to their maximum. When done properly, 1 + 1 will equal 3, but this should be happening naturally as the benefit of having a Red and Blue team.
 
You can read more about the different teams [here](https://danielmiessler.com/study/red-blue-purple-teams/)!
 
At this point a lot of newbies trying to break into security get lost, and begin to ask for directions. Many of us want to follow the Red Team path and have the "sexy" job of being an attacker or "hacker" as many call it, but there are also many "sexy" jobs working for both the Blue and Purple Teams.
 
A lot of research has to go into these teams, so you need to match up your passions, and interests to the job duties.
 
So what are some jobs associated with the teams?
 
* Red Team:
    * Penetration Tester
    * Security Consultant (Attacker)
    * Red Team Pentester
* Blue Team:
    * Information Security Analyst
    * Security Engineer
    * Security Consultant (Infrastructure)
* Purple Team:
    * All the Above
 
__5. Practice, Practice, Practice... and Practice some more!__
 
Once you find your niche, and have decided what field you want to pursue in security, it's time to learn the tools of your trade.
 
Hopefully by this time you already know a language or two and understand the basic principles of Windows and *Nix OS's. Now it's time to delve deeper into what you need to know.
 
__Red Team__:
If you want to get into Pentesting then you need a wide range of knowledge. Pick up and learn the following languages, and master the Kali Linux Distro. Also, make sure you understand Networking (TCP/IP, OSI) really well due to the fact that it's the underlying baseline for pentesting.
 
For languages, you need to know:
* PHP
* HTML
* SQL
* Python (or Ruby)
* JavaScript
* C/C++ (This is for when you want to create exploits)
 
As a Pentester you need to have a wide experience of languages due to the fact that you might encounter them during a regular pentest, whether that is a Web Pentest or Network Pentest.
 
Tools you need to learn how to use:
* [Metasploit](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/)
* Nmap
* Wireshark & tcpdump
* John The Ripper
* THC Hydra
* Hashcat
* And more...
 
You can find all these tools in the [Kali Linux Distro](https://www.kali.org/). Learn them, understand them, and utilize them!
 
Practice: Here are some good links to practice your hacking skills.
* [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/resources/)
* [Pentestit](https://lab.pentestit.ru/)
* [OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/)
* [Pentester Labs](https://pentesterlab.com/exercises/)
 
Also I suggest you look up CTF's (Capture the Flag) events and participate in them. A few good beginner ones I would suggest is:
* [CASW](https://ctf.csaw.io/)
* [NCL](https://www.nationalcyberleague.org/)
* [CTF365](https://ctf365.com/)
 
For more info on CTF's I suggest you go to [ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/).
 
Pick up some books such as:
* [The Hacker Playbook 2: Practical Guide To Penetration Testing](http://www.amazon.com/Hacker-Playbook-Practical-Penetration-Testing/dp/1512214566)
* [Hacking: The Art of Exploitation](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hacking-Art-Exploitation-Jon-Erickson/dp/1593271441/278-8912673-2641667?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0)
* [Black Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Hat-Python-Programming-Pentesters/dp/1593275900/ref=pd_sim_14_4?ie=UTF8&dpID=51FbEc47koL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR121%2C160_&refRID=3FQDHMNHDP7HH1JAJ7SP)
* [Rtfm: Red Team Field Manual](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rtfm-Red-Team-Field-Manual/dp/1494295504/ref=pd_sim_14_3?ie=UTF8&dpID=31QXtYn4UiL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR104%2C160_&refRID=3FQDHMNHDP7HH1JAJ7SP)
 
The Hackers Playbook is great resources to get you started and take you step by step on pen testing that will allow you to explore the endless possibilities. The Art of Exploitation is also very good, but it's more for exploit writing and buffer overflows and is to be considered for more advanced professionals that have a hardened understanding of C/C++ and Assembly.
 
__Blue Team__:
If you want to get into Blue Team work and be on the defense for any company then you don't have to learn many languages but you do need to learn the tools and terminology, and you need to learn the environment.
 
For languages you need to know:
* PowerShell (CMD... but PowerShell is better!)
* Bash (*Nix Scripting)
* Python (or Ruby)
 
If you know Java or C/C++ then those languages will also be very beneficial for you if you need to create new tools or automate tasks. For my job I usually stick with Python and PowerShell.
 
Tools you need to learn how to use:
* Wireshark
* Nmap
* Command line
 
Unfortunately each company has a different environment, ranging from McAfee, to Symantec, to Carbon Black, to Cisco... to you name it!
 
The problem with a lot of industry jobs is that people are lacking experience with environmental tools. Meaning that if a company is running full McAfee IDS/IPS, NSM, NTBA, Web Gateway, and Checkpoint Firewall Blades, then that company will require you to have experience or an understanding of those tools and devices.
 
The best possible way is to just Google stuff about an environment and learn from the free resources, or from the online User Manuals!
 
Pick up some books such as:
* [Blue Team Handbook: Incident Response Edition: A condensed field guide for the Cyber Security Incident Responder](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Team-Handbook-condensed-Responder/dp/1500734756)
* [The Practice of Network Security Monitoring: Understanding Incident Detection and Response](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Network-Security-Monitoring-Understanding/dp/1593275099/ref=pd_sim_14_6/132-5955365-4868230?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1593275099&pd_rd_r=HPCZBE6R5H8KH2FJATKV&pd_rd_w=BXPik&pd_rd_wg=igyIa&psc=1&refRID=HPCZBE6R5H8KH2FJATKV)

* [Black Hat](http://blackhat.com/)
* [DEFCON](https://www.defcon.org/index.html)
 
__7. Get Certified__
 
Many people might argue that certificates are a waste of time and they don't prove someone’s knowledge - which although at times is true, but is actually rather false.
 
Many jobs in Security require you to have at least a basic certificate and some years of experience to get a job, by attaining a certificate you can bypass HR filters and actually score an interview. Think of these certs as a "foot in the door" and also as a personal achievement.
 
Some certificates I suggest you look at are:
* [CompTIA Security+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/security)
* [CompTIA CSA+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst)
* [GIAC GSEC](https://www.giac.org/certification/security-essentials-gsec)
* [GIAC GCIH](https://www.giac.org/certification/certified-incident-handler-gcih)
* [GIAC GPEN](https://www.giac.org/certification/penetration-tester-gpen)
* [CCNA Security](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna-security.html)
* [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/cissp/default.aspx)
* [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/)
 
Now this is just a broad list of certificates, I'm not suggesting you get all of them, only the ones that are related to your job/niche.
 
__8. Find a Job__
 
Finding a Job is rather an easy task since there are so many opening worldwide! The only problem is actually getting the job.
 
For students who are still in College, I suggest you start looking for Internships that are directly related to the security field. There are a ton of open internships, you just need to find them!
 
Some Internships/Junior position jobs will require you to either have graduated with a Bachelor Degree or have some sort of IT Experience. If you don't have either then I suggest one of two things:
1. Go back to School and get a Bachelor's Degree
    * And find a Security Internship
2. Find an entry level IT Position
    * Either in Help Desk, Networking, or System Administration
 
The problem with the Security Field is that a lot of positions require you to have a Bachelor Degree minimum! It's rather impossible to find a job that won't require that, nonetheless, one that will hire you.
 
If you don't have a degree, then with certificates and self-learning you might have a fighting chance, so don't lose all hope! But you will seriously need to understand the basics and intermediate topics inside, and out!
 
If you have no IT Experience whatsoever then I highly suggest you start in the lower ranks and move up to security. Specifically start at a Help Desk Position, a Junior Networking position or Sysadmin Position and move your way up the ranks. As I already explained earlier, you need to have a wide range of knowledge to break into Security which range from networking, system administrations, and more! After 2-3 years you can try to move into Security internally or apply for Junior Positions around your area.
 
In all honesty, fake it till you make it, and then fake it till you become it! I'm not saying get a job that you don't know how to do anything, but learn enough to get by the interview, and get hired. One then, you will need to work your butt off, ask questions, and learn quickly by yourself to stay afloat. This single handedly is one of the best ways to learn quickly and gain massive experience!
 
Also, as I mentioned before - go to Security Conferences, meet people, and network. Who knows, someone there might be looking to hire you, you just need to show them the passion in your eyes, and how much you really want the job and are willing to learn!
